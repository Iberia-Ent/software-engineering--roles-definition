## What we expect from you

You are expected to support the Solution Architects in driving forward solutions for applications, aligning these with the business and technical strategic vision and goals. We expect you to show a proactive attitude, and the ability to work with supervision, gradually developing towards working with more autonomy.
We would love to hear your experience in these tasks in previous jobs.
