But we are keen to know other things that can be of importance: Side projects, other stack knowledge, hidden skills…

There are some people that will be able to assist you: There is a Software Engineering Team that can help with architectural, design, or other high-level problems; there are devops and cloud engineers to help in more specific needs, some key roles such as Tech Leads and Solutions Architects to support and guide you... You will not be alone.

## The goods

- There is a defined career path in the company so every software engineer can grow
- Flexible work hours (with some hot hours in Spain time)
- Mainly remote – there will be some presential sessions in La Muñoza (Madrid)
- We are investing in your training, so of course we would like for you to stay in Iberia for a long time
