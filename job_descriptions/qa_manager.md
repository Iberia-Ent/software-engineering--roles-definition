# QA Manager

## Role Summary: The Quality Architect

The **QA Manager** is the primary architect and strategist for software quality in the company. Their mission is not to execute tests directly, but to **design, lead, and oversee the global strategy** that ensures our products are built with the highest quality from day one. They do not focus on finding defects, but on building an ecosystem that prevents them, fostering a culture where quality is a shared responsibility.

They act as the bridge between business objectives and technical quality practices, ensuring that every effort in quality has a measurable and positive impact on our customers and the company. It is a leadership role focused on long-term vision, continuous process improvement, and cultural change management.

## Primary Role Mission: Global Strategist and Change Driver

The QA Manager is **ultimately responsible for defining, leading, and overseeing the company's software quality strategy.** Their role is more tactical and strategic than purely technical. They define the **"what"** (the quality objectives) and the **"why"** (their alignment with the business), establishing the vision and strategic direction that will guide the entire organization. They are the final decision-maker on quality matters affecting the entire company, ensuring coherence, sustainability, and long-term value creation.

## Key Responsibility Areas

These are the areas that the QA Manager must master and over which they have full ownership.

<ol>
    <li><strong>Strategic Leadership and Tool Governance</strong></li>
    Defines the direction to follow and has the final say on the tools and technologies we use to ensure quality.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Defines the strategic needs</strong> for QA tools and technologies, anticipating future market and product demands.</li>
        <li><strong>Evaluates and makes the final decision (approves or rejects)</strong> on tool and methodology proposals submitted by QA Champions. Their decision is based on rigorous business criteria: <strong>scalability</strong> (can this tool support the company's growth?), <strong>cost</strong> (does it offer a clear return on investment?), and <strong>strategic alignment</strong> (does it integrate with our existing architecture and culture?).</li>
        <li><strong>Drives the adoption</strong> of approved solutions, not just by giving the green light, but also by ensuring that the necessary resources and support are in place for a successful implementation, using QA Champions as change facilitators within the teams.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Driving Quality from the Start (Shift-Left Culture)</strong></li>
    Their job is to evangelize a mindset where quality is not a final phase, but everyone's responsibility from the conception of an idea.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Designs and leads the internal communication strategy</strong> to promote the "Shift-Left" mindset. This includes sharing quantified success stories, organizing departmental "roadshows" to showcase tangible benefits, and demonstrating with data how early quality practices reduce costs, minimize rework, and accelerate value delivery to the customer.</li>
        <li><strong>Actively facilitates the adoption</strong> of this culture across all development teams, acting as a coach and removing organizational barriers that impede its implementation.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Business Alignment</strong></li>
    Translates technical efforts into understandable business results and vice-versa.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ensures that the QA strategy directly supports the company's objectives.</strong> Every quality initiative must have a clear business justification.</li>
        <li><strong>Must be able to translate technical metrics into business impact.</strong> For example: "Reduce the Defect Escape Rate by 50% to increase customer satisfaction (NPS) by 10 points" or "implement automated performance tests to reduce page load time by 30%, which directly impacts the sales conversion rate." This translation is fundamental to gaining management support.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Management and Development of External QA Talent</strong></li>
    Ensures the maximum excellence and development of external QA teams.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Defines the necessary profiles and competencies</strong> for each QA role, creating a clear standard for talent acquisition.</li>
        <li><strong>Performs the final validation of QA profiles.</strong> After the selection process by the service providers, they are responsible for interviewing and giving the final approval to the most suitable candidate. Beyond technical aptitude, they assess collaboration skills, proactivity, and cultural fit with the team's values.</li>
        <li><strong>Oversees and validates the training plans of service providers.</strong> Through the QA Champions, they ensure that providers train their teams to meet the defined quality standards. This involves periodically reviewing these plans and offering feedback so they can be adapted to the company's new technologies and challenges.</li>
        <li><strong>Fosters a mentorship and follow-up program,</strong> led by the QA Champions, to ensure consistency and excellence in the external service, ensuring the provider's training plan is adapted to the company's needs and strategic direction.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Fostering Interdepartmental Collaboration</strong></li>
    Breaks down barriers between teams so that Quality, Development, and Product work as a single unit from the beginning.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Institutionalizes a phased collaboration model:</strong></li>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Phase 1 (Definition):</strong> Promotes early working sessions between <strong>Business, Product Owner, and QA.</strong> The goal is to refine and clarify requirements so that epics and user stories reach the development team with a QA "seal of approval." This drastically reduces uncertainty and rework in later stages.</li>
            <li><strong>Phase 2 (Technical Alignment):</strong> Once the requirements are validated, they facilitate <strong>"Three Amigos" sessions (Product, Development, QA)</strong> to ensure a shared technical understanding, resolve doubts, and allow for accurate effort estimation, transforming requirements into a viable and agreed-upon technical action plan.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Governance and Impact Measurement</strong></li>
    Oversees that the strategy is correctly applied and measures its success not only with technical metrics but also with the value it brings to the business.
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Defines and monitors an agile governance framework</strong> (e.g., a set of flexible guidelines instead of a rigid process, with regular but not bureaucratic checkpoints) for the implementation of the quality strategy.</li>
        <li><strong>Measures the impact of quality by linking it to business indicators.</strong> Their goal is to go beyond technical metrics to demonstrate how quality improvements contribute to the company's objectives, ensuring that the investment generates a measurable return (ROI).</li>
    </ul>
</ol>

## Specific Tasks and Activities

These are the concrete actions the QA Manager performs to fulfill their responsibilities.

### Planning and Design:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Design and maintain the "Shift-Left" transformation plan,</strong> which must include the identification of pilot teams, the definition of success metrics for the transformation, a communication plan, and proactive management of resistance to change.</li>
    <li><strong>Define and document the company's quality standards,</strong> including robust criteria for the <strong>"Definition of Ready" (DoR) and "Definition of Done" (DoD)</strong>, which explicitly incorporate aspects like performance acceptance criteria, minimum unit test coverage, and basic security validations.</li>
    <li><strong>Evaluate and validate proofs of concept (PoCs)</strong> and tool proposals, making the final decision on their corporate implementation based on a clear cost-benefit analysis.</li>
</ul>

### Execution and Support:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Supervise the progressive implementation</strong> of the standards, acting as an internal consultant for the teams and helping them adapt the guidelines to their specific context.</li>
    <li><strong>Promotes and drives the adoption of key methodologies</strong> such as Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). They facilitate and sponsor the organization of training sessions but delegate the technical execution and teaching to the QA Champions, ensuring the focus remains on strategic value and not on implementation, which is the responsibility of the technical teams.</li>
    <li><strong>Lead the monthly follow-up sessions</strong> with the QA Champion (or Principal QA), where progress is reviewed, impediments are unblocked, learnings are shared, and the strategy is adjusted according to emerging business needs.</li>
</ul>

### Measurement and Reporting:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Define and evolve global quality metrics (KPIs),</strong> including "Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)" for critical defects, "Cost of Non-Quality (CoNQ)," and "Return on Investment in Test Automation (Test Automation ROI)."</li>
    <li><strong>Create and maintain centralized and accessible tracking dashboards</strong> (using corporate tools <strong>Jira, Xray, and Jellyfish</strong>). The goal is to democratize data, allowing any stakeholder to check the state of quality autonomously and transparently.</li>
    <li><strong>Prepare and present monthly reports</strong> on the state of quality, highlighting achievements, challenges, and progress toward strategic objectives, addressed to the Head of Software Engineering and other stakeholders.</li>
</ul>

### Interdepartmental Collaboration:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Actively participate in Architecture, Product, and DevOps committees</strong> to anticipate quality challenges arising from new architectures or high-impact features, ensuring quality is considered from the design phase.</li>
    <li><strong>Selectively attend key team ceremonies</strong> to get a feel for the organization's pulse, gather firsthand feedback, and validate that the strategy is being applied coherently and effectively.</li>
</ul>

## What We Expect from a QA Manager

<ul>
    <li><strong>Strategic Vision:</strong> The ability to see the big picture, anticipate trends, and design a long-term plan that aligns quality with the company's objectives. This is materialized in the creation of a 1, 2, and 3-year quality roadmap.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspiring Leadership:</strong> The ability to manage, guide, and mentor the QA Champion (or Principal QA) and influence the entire organization to adopt a quality culture. They must be a change agent who persuades with data and vision, not just hierarchical authority.</li>
    <li><strong>Business Mindset:</strong> Understanding that quality is not an end in itself but a means to improve the product, and being able to articulate how a specific quality initiative contributes to increasing revenue, reducing operational costs, or improving customer retention.</li>
    <li><strong>Excellent Communication Skills:</strong> The ability to communicate complex ideas simply and convincingly, adapting the level of detail and the message's focus to each audience, from engineers to the management committee.</li>
    <li><strong>Strategic Decision-Making on Technical Proposals:</strong> Although not a technical execution role, they must be able to understand and evaluate the strategic impact of technical proposals presented by QA Champions. The responsibility for technical feasibility and detail lies with the Champions; the QA Manager's role is to make the final decision based on how that proposal aligns with global objectives, cost, and scalability. The QA Manager trusts their Champions for the technical "how," while focusing on the strategic "why" and the "what" value it brings to the business.</li>
</ul>
