# QA Manager

## Role Summary: The Quality Architect

The **QA Manager** is the company's global quality strategist and a key driver of cultural change. Their mission is to define, lead, and oversee the software quality strategy, ensuring it is deeply aligned with business objectives. This role is more strategic and tactical than technical; they establish the "what" and "why" of quality, setting the vision and being the final decision-maker on matters affecting the entire organization.

They are responsible for promoting a "Shift-Left" mindset, where quality is built into the product from its inception, and for guaranteeing that the investment in quality yields a measurable return for the business. They provide the vision, the framework, and the governance that empower the teams to deliver high-quality products efficiently and consistently.

## What we expect from you

<ul>
    <li><strong>Strategic and Business Vision:</strong> The ability to see beyond technical metrics and translate quality initiatives into tangible business impact. You must think like a business leader who specializes in quality and connect quality improvements to goals like increased customer satisfaction, reduced support costs, or faster time-to-market.</li>
    <li><strong>Inspirational Leadership and Influence:</strong> The capacity to lead without direct authority, inspiring and persuading teams and stakeholders at all levels to adopt new quality practices. You drive change through influence, clear communication, and demonstrating value, not by command.</li>
    <li><strong>Data-Driven Decision-Making:</strong> A strong analytical mindset, making critical decisions about tools, processes, and strategy based on objective data and KPIs. You use metrics to tell a compelling story about the state of quality and to justify strategic choices.</li>
    <li><strong>Excellent Communication and Negotiation Skills:</strong> The ability to articulate a clear strategic vision to both technical and executive audiences, and to negotiate for the resources, priorities, and timelines needed to ensure the success of the quality strategy.</li>
    <li><strong>Strategic Technical Understanding:</strong> While not a hands-on technical role, you must possess a deep understanding of QA methodologies, processes, and the technology landscape. This knowledge is crucial for making informed strategic decisions and evaluating proposals from QA Champions with credibility.</li>
</ul>

## How you will work

As the QA Manager, your work is focused on high-level planning, governance, and enablement. You will design and maintain the company's **Shift-Left transformation plan**, which includes communication strategies, risk management, and a phased implementation roadmap. You will also define and document the company's **quality standards**, including robust criteria for the Definition of Ready (DoR) and Definition of Done (DoD).

A significant part of your role involves **governance and oversight**. You will lead monthly strategic sessions with the **QA Champions** to set direction, evaluate their technical proposals (PoCs), and make the final decision on their corporate adoption based on scalability, cost, and strategic alignment. You will also oversee the implementation of the quality strategy, ensuring external service providers comply with the necessary training and certification plans.

Your work is heavily data-oriented. You will define and evolve key quality metrics (KPIs) and maintain centralized tracking dashboards using corporate tools like **Jira, Xray, and Jellyfish**. You will prepare and present monthly and quarterly reports (QBRs) on the state of quality, highlighting progress toward strategic objectives.

## With whom

You will work closely with the **QA Champions**, who are your primary agents for implementing the strategy. You provide them with strategic direction and mentorship, and they provide you with technical insights and on-the-ground execution.

You will report to and collaborate with the **Head of Software Engineering** and other **senior stakeholders**, aligning the quality strategy with broader engineering and business goals and communicating its value and impact.

To ensure a holistic approach, you will actively participate in **Architecture, Product, and DevOps committees** to identify cross-cutting dependencies and risks that could impact product quality.

You will foster early collaboration by standardizing "Two Amigos" sessions, working with **Business stakeholders and Product Owners (POs)** before technical refinement to ensure requirements are clear and unambiguous.

Finally, you will be responsible for **validating new QA profiles** before they join the company, ensuring they have the right skills and mindset to contribute to our quality culture.
