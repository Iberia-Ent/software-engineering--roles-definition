# Job Descriptions

You have a [template](./template.md) to create your own job description for a recruitment process.

You can also find multiple examples of job descriptions to help you creating one that suits your needs.

To generate a PDF with the markdown of the description, you can use npm (e.g. `npx markdown-pdf senior_java_backend_resiliency.md`) or an [online service](https://www.markdowntopdf.com/)
