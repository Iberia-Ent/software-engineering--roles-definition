- Manage the technical career paths, technical skills, and structure of the engineering teams.
- Make data-driven decisions regarding engineering performance and capabilities.
- Foster a culture of collaboration, innovation, and continuous improvement within the engineering team.
- Collaborate with cross-functional teams, including product managers, designers, and stakeholders, to align on technical requirements and deliverables.
- Identify and mitigate risks and issues that may impact product delivery or team performance.
- Stay up-to-date with industry trends and best practices in software engineering, and apply them to drive innovation and improve team performance.
- Work with the engineering team, product owners, and stakeholders to define key metrics related to code quality and delivery. These metrics could include code coverage, code complexity, defect density, build and deployment frequency, lead time for changes, cycle time, and customer satisfaction metrics.
- Establish baseline metrics to understand the current state of code quality and delivery performance. Set achievable targets for improvement based on industry benchmarks, organizational goals, and feedback from stakeholders. Regularly monitor progress towards these targets and adjust strategies as needed.
- Implement metrics to track the performance of individual team members and product teams.
