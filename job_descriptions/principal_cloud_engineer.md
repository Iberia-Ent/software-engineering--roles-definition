# Principal Cloud Engineer

## Role Description

As a Principal Cloud Engineer, you are the organization's most senior technical expert in cloud engineering, working across all business domains to establish technical standards, solve complex challenges, and drive cloud engineering excellence. Unlike Cloud Leads who focus on specific domains, you operate at the organizational level, providing technical leadership and guidance to all cloud teams. You will work closely with the Principal Cloud Architect to ensure technical implementation aligns with the strategic cloud vision. This role combines deep technical expertise with cross-organizational influence, focusing on establishing best practices, leading technical initiatives, and ensuring consistency in cloud engineering across all products and domains.

## What you will do

- **Technical Leadership:** Provide technical leadership and guidance across all cloud engineering teams, establishing standards and best practices that apply organization-wide.

- **Cross-Domain Architecture:** Design and oversee implementation of cloud solutions that span multiple domains, ensuring technical consistency and optimization at scale.

- **Complex Problem Solving:** Lead the resolution of the most complex technical challenges that affect multiple teams or require deep cloud expertise beyond domain boundaries.

- **Standards & Frameworks:** Define and maintain organization-wide cloud engineering standards, frameworks, and patterns including IaC templates, security baselines, and operational procedures.

- **Technical Mentorship:** Mentor Cloud Leads and senior engineers across all domains, providing technical guidance and fostering growth in cloud engineering capabilities.

- **Innovation & Research:** Research and evaluate emerging cloud technologies, lead proof-of-concepts, and drive adoption of innovative solutions across the organization.

- **Technical Reviews:** Conduct technical reviews for critical infrastructure decisions, major architectural changes, and cross-domain initiatives.

- **Knowledge Sharing:** Lead the Cloud Engineering Guild, organizing technical workshops, creating reference architectures, and ensuring knowledge transfer across teams.

## What we expect from you

- **Technical Expertise:**
    - Expert-level knowledge of AWS services and architectural patterns
    - Master-level proficiency with Terraform and Infrastructure as Code at enterprise scale
    - Deep expertise in containerization (Docker, ECS, EKS) and serverless architectures
    - Deep understanding of the differences between cloud-native, cloud ready, and legacy systems
    - Extensive experience with observability, monitoring, and performance optimization
    - Advanced programming skills in at least one language (Python, Java, etc.)
    - Expert understanding of cloud security, networking, and compliance
- **Leadership Skills:**
    - Proven ability to influence and drive technical decisions across multiple teams
    - Experience establishing technical standards adopted organization-wide
    - Track record of mentoring senior engineers and technical leads
    - Ability to balance technical perfection with business pragmatism
- **Problem Solving:** Exceptional analytical skills with ability to solve novel, complex problems that have no precedent
- **Communication:** Outstanding ability to communicate complex technical concepts to diverse audiences, from engineers to executives

Preferred Qualifications:
- Contributions to open-source cloud tools or frameworks
- Familiarity with software architecture patterns (microservices, event-driven, etc.)
- Experience with cloud cost optimization and FinOps practices

## Internal Promotion Criteria:

Consistent exceeds-expectations performance reviews
Leadership recognition for technical contributions
Successful completion of high-impact, cross-domain initiatives
Positive feedback from mentored engineers and peer teams
Demonstrated growth through Cloud Engineer and Cloud Lead roles

## How you will work

- **Organization-Wide Impact:** Work across all business domains and product teams, not tied to any specific area, ensuring technical excellence everywhere.
- **Strategic Technical Leadership:** Partner with the Principal Cloud Architect to translate strategic vision into technical implementation and standards.
- **Hands-On Excellence:** Maintain deep technical involvement in the most challenging problems while setting examples through code and architecture.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration:** Float between teams as needed, providing expertise where it's most critical and ensuring knowledge spreads across the organization.
- **Continuous Learning:** Stay at the forefront of cloud technology, bringing cutting-edge solutions and practices to the organization.

You will work with teams across the organization and handle technical documentation in English and Spanish, so proficiency in both languages is required.

**There is a defined career path in the company, with opportunities to grow into architectural or executive technical leadership roles**

## With whom

You will report directly to the Principal Cloud Architect, working together to align technical implementation with strategic vision. Your primary interactions include Cloud Leads from all domains whom you'll guide and mentor, Cloud Engineers across the organization who will look to you for technical leadership, and Product teams seeking expertise for complex challenges.

You'll collaborate closely with Solutions Architects on organization-wide initiatives, DevSecOps teams on security and compliance standards, and Software Engineering leadership on cross-functional technical decisions. As a member of the technical leadership team, you'll also work with other Principal Engineers from different disciplines to ensure cohesive technical strategies across the organization. Your influence will extend to all cloud engineering efforts, making you a key technical authority in the company.
