# Cloud Engineer

## Role Description

The Cloud Engineer is responsible for implementing, and maintaining scalable cloud infrastructure on AWS. This role ensures that cloud infrastructure follows best practices, is reliable, secure, and cost-effective. The Cloud Engineer works closely with the solution architects and development teams to enable cloud adoption and implements monitoring solutions to ensure optimal system performance. Working primarily with AWS, Terraform, and various observability tools, the Cloud Engineer bridges the gap between infrastructure and development teams, fostering a collaborative environment focused on continuous improvement.

## Responsibilities

- **Infrastructure Management:** implement, and maintain AWS cloud infrastructure following the Well-Architected Framework principles. Write and maintain Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.
- **Monitoring & Observability:** Implement and configure monitoring solutions (Dynatrace, CloudWatch). Design alerts for proactive issue detection and analyze metrics and telemetry data to identify performance bottlenecks.
- **Container & Serverless:** Deploy and manage containerized applications using ECS and Docker. Implement and optimize serverless architectures.
- **Collaboration & Enablement:** Partner with development teams to enable cloud adoption and best practices. Act as a bridge between infrastructure and development teams.
- **Code Review & Documentation:** Conduct infrastructure code reviews and participate in pair programming sessions. Document cloud architectures, operational procedures, and best practices.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize cloud resources for performance and cost-efficiency.
- **CI/CD Support:** Collaborate on CI/CD pipeline configurations and ensure infrastructure changes are integrated into deployment workflows.

## What we expect from you

- **Educational Background:** Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science, Information Technology or equivalent practical experience.
- **Experience:** 3+ years of hands-on experience with AWS cloud services and infrastructure management.
- **Technical Skills:**
    - Good understanding of cloud architecture principles and ability to implement architectural designs
    - Strong experience with AWS services (EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, IAM, etc.)
    - Proficiency in Terraform for Infrastructure as Code
    - Solid knowledge of Docker and container orchestration with ECS/EKS
    - Experience with serverless and cloud-native architectures (API Gateway, Cloudfront, etc)
    - Understanding of monitoring tools and telemetry concepts
    - Proficiency in at least one scripting language (Python, Bash, or similar)
    - Version control with Git
- **Soft Skills:**
    - Strong interpersonal skills with ability to work effectively in cross-functional teams
    - Excellent communication skills to explain technical concepts to various stakeholders
    - Proactive problem-solving approach
    - Collaborative mindset with focus on knowledge sharing

Preferred Qualifications:
- Experience with Kubernetes/EKS or ECS
- Understanding of security best practices in cloud environments
- Good understanding of CI/CD concepts and tools
- Good knowledge of one or more programming languages (Java, Python, etc.)
- Experience with observability tools (Dynatrace, CloudWatch, etc.)
- Strong knowledge of networking concepts in cloud environments(Transit Gateway, Route tables, Route53 Resolver, etc.)

## How you will work

- **Highly Collaborative Culture:** You'll work closely with developers, product owners, and other cloud engineers in a collaborative environment focused on knowledge sharing and continuous improvement.
- **Agile Methodology:** Participate in sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives as part of product-oriented teams with high autonomy.
- **Mentorship & Growth:** Access to Solutions Architects, Tech Leads, and DevSecOps teams for guidance. Regular team sessions for sharing best practices and learnings.
- **Innovation Focus:** Work with modern cloud technologies including serverless architectures, containerization, and cutting-edge observability practices.

## With whom

You will be part of an agile product team working alongside Product Owners, QAs, Scrum Masters, and Developers. You'll collaborate closely with the Cloud Enablement Engine and other Cloud Engineers across the organization to establish and maintain cloud standards.

Support is available from Software Engineering Teams and Solutions Architects who provide architectural designs and guidance, DevSecOps teams for security practices, and key roles such as Tech Leads who will help translate architectural vision into implementation. You'll also engage with stakeholders across different product teams, sharing your infrastructure expertise and learning from others in a culture of continuous improvement.
