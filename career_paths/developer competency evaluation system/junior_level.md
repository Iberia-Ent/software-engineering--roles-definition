## Total Minimum Points Calculation

- **Core Skills Total:** 11 points  
- **Secondary Skills Total:** 8 points  
- **Overall Total Minimum Required:** 11 + 8 = **19 points**

---

## Validation Process for Junior Candidates

A candidate is classified as Junior if they meet **all** the following criteria:

1. **Core Skills Requirement:**  
   Every Core skill must be demonstrated at a Basic level (1 point). If any Core skill is below Basic, the candidate does not satisfy the Junior criteria.

2. **Secondary Skills Requirement:**  
   All Secondary skills must be demonstrated at a Basic level (1 point).

3. **Total Points Requirement:**  
   The candidate’s cumulative score (from both Core and Secondary skills) must be **at least 19 points**. A score below this threshold indicates that the candidate does not fully meet the Junior level expectations.
