# Backend Developer Competency Evaluation System – Semi-senior Level

This evaluation system is based on a points model:
- **Basic:** 1 point  
- **Intermediate:** 3 points  
- **Advanced:** 5 points  
- **Expert:** 7 points (applicable at the Senior level)

To advance from Semi-senior to Semi-senior Advanced, candidates must:
1. Achieve at least the minimum required points in each **Core** skill.
2. Reach a total minimum score across all evaluated skills.

### Total Minimum Points Calculation

- **Core Skills Total:** 14 skills × 5 points each = **70 points**
- **Secondary Skills Total:** **31 points**
- **Overall Total Minimum Required:** 70 + 31 = **101 points**

---

## Semi-senior Level: Validation Process for Advancement

To be eligible for advancement from Semi-senior to Semi-senior Advanced, a candidate must satisfy both conditions:

1. **Core Skills Requirement:**  
   The candidate must demonstrate at or above the required proficiency for each Core skill:
   - **SQL, OOP & Programming, Java, REST Services, Persistence Frameworks, Spring, Transactions, CI/CD, Design Patterns, Git, Test, Architecture, Security, and AWS** must each be at **Advanced (5 points)**.
   
   *If any one of these Core skills is below Advanced (5 points), the candidate cannot advance, even if the overall score meets the threshold.*

2. **Total Points Requirement:**  
   The candidate’s overall score—calculated by summing the points from all evaluated skills—must be **at least 101 points**.
   - *For example, if a candidate’s total score is 100 points, they do not meet the threshold to advance.*

A candidate can only advance from Semi-senior to Semi-senior Advanced if both conditions are met.
