# Backend Developer Competency Evaluation System – Junior Advance Level

This document defines a realistic transition from **Junior** to **Junior Advance** in the backend development domain, taking into account the following career levels:

**Junior → Junior Advance → Semi-senior → Semi-senior Advanced → Senior**

The evaluation is based on a points system, where competency levels are defined as:
- **Basic:** 1 point  
- **Intermediate:** 3 points  
- **Advanced:** 5 points  
- **Expert:** 7 points (applicable at the Senior level)

To advance from Junior to Junior Advance, the candidate must:
1. Achieve the minimum required level in each **Core** skill.
2. Attain a minimum overall score across all evaluated skills.

## Total Minimum Points Calculation

- **Core Skills Total (Mandatory):**  
  Approximate sum:  
  SQL (3) + OOP & Programming (3) + Java (3) + REST Services (3) + Persistence Frameworks (3) + Spring (3) + Transactions (min. 1–3) + CI/CD (min. 1–3) + Design Patterns (1) + Git (3) + Test (min. 1–3)  
  **Approximate Total:** 27 to 33 points (depending on the evaluation in Transactions, CI/CD, and Test).

- **Secondary Skills Total:**  
  Soft Skills (3) + Workstation (1) + Web (1) + Scrum (1) + Logging (1) + Building/Packaging (1) + Documentation (1) + Spring Ecosystem (3)  
  **Total:** 12 points

- **Overall Minimum Score:**  
  **Approximately 39 to 45 points**

> **Consideration:**  
> To advance from Junior to Junior Advance, it is suggested that the candidate reach an overall minimum of **around 40 points**. This allows for consolidation of fundamentals without requiring the advanced mastery expected at the Semi-senior level or above.

---

## Validation Process for Advancement

To be eligible for the transition from Junior to Junior Advance, the candidate must satisfy both conditions:

1. **Core Skills Requirement:**  
   The candidate must demonstrate at least the minimum required level in each core skill (e.g., SQL, OOP, Java, etc.).  
   *If any core skill is below the minimum, advancement is not permitted, even if the overall score meets the threshold.*

2. **Total Points Requirement:**  
   The sum of the points obtained across all evaluated skills must meet or exceed the established threshold (approximately 40 points in this model).

---

This model is designed to reflect a realistic progression where the Junior candidate consolidates essential backend development fundamentals, preparing for greater responsibilities at higher levels without being overburdened with requirements that are more appropriate for Semi-senior or Senior roles.
