# Senior Level Summary – Backend Developer Competency Evaluation

This document serves as a reference during external interviews to assess whether a candidate meets our Senior level requirements. It details the scoring model, required proficiencies, validation criteria, and provides a comprehensive table of skills with the expected levels.

---

## Scoring Model

- **Basic:** 1 point  
- **Intermediate:** 3 points  
- **Advanced:** 5 points  
- **Expert:** 7 points

At the Senior level, all **Core Skills** must be demonstrated at an **Expert** level (7 points), while **Secondary Skills** must be maintained at or above their specified minimum levels. The overall score is determined by the sum of points from both Core and Secondary skills.

---

## Required Skill Proficiencies

### Core Skills (Must be Expert – 7 points each)
- **SQL**
- **OOP & Programming**
- **Java**
- **REST Services**
- **Persistence Frameworks**
- **Spring**
- **Transactions**
- **CI/CD**
- **Design Patterns**
- **Git**
- **Test**
- **Architecture**
- **Microservices**
- **Security**
- **AWS**
- **Algorithms & Data Structures**
- **Logging**

*These 17 core skills reflect the deep technical mastery expected of a Senior Backend Developer. Notice that, compared to previous definitions, **NoSQL** has been removed from the core skills since it is not considered as essential at this level.*

### Secondary Skills (Minimum Levels)
- **Soft Skills:** Expert (7 points)
- **Web:** Basic (1 point)
- **Scrum:** Intermediate (3 points)
- **Building/Packaging:** Intermediate (3 points)
- **Documentation:** Intermediate (3 points)
- **Spring Ecosystem:** Expert (7 points)
- **Cryptography:** Expert (7 points)
- **IaaC:** Basic (1 point)
- **Workstation:** Basic (1 point)
- **NoSQL:** Intermediate (3 points)

*These secondary skills complement the core technical areas with essential soft skills, system thinking, and operational capabilities. In particular, while **Algorithms & Data Structures** and **Logging** are now core (and thus indispensable), skills like **NoSQL**, **Scrum**, and **Workstation** have been moved to the secondary category and set to lower thresholds.*

## Total Minimum Points Calculation

- **Core Skills Total:** 119 points  
- **Secondary Skills Total:** 36 points  
- **Overall Total Minimum Required:** 119 + 36 = **155 points**

## Validation Process for Senior Candidates

A candidate is classified as Senior if they meet **all** the following criteria:

1. **Core Skills Requirement:**  
   Every Core skill must be demonstrated at an Expert level (7 points). If any Core skill is below Expert (e.g., Advanced at 5 points), the candidate does not satisfy the Senior criteria.

2. **Secondary Skills Requirement:**  
   All Secondary skills must be maintained at or above the specified minimum levels.

3. **Total Points Requirement:**  
   The candidate’s cumulative score (from both Core and Secondary skills) must be **at least 155 points**. A score below this threshold indicates the candidate does not fully meet the Senior level expectations.
