- **Secondary Skills Total:** 47 points  
- **Overall Total Minimum Required:** 112 + 47 = **159 points**

## Validation Process for Senior Candidates

A candidate is classified as Senior if they meet **all** the following criteria:

1. **Core Skills Requirement:**  
   Every Core skill must be demonstrated at an Expert level (7 points). If any Core skill is below Expert (e.g., Advanced at 5 points), the candidate does not satisfy the Senior criteria.

2. **Secondary Skills Requirement:**  
   All Secondary skills must be maintained at or above the specified minimum levels.

3. **Total Points Requirement:**  
   The candidate’s cumulative score (from both Core and Secondary skills) must be **at least 159 points**. A score below this threshold indicates the candidate does not fully meet the Senior level expectations.
