# Backend Developer Competency Evaluation System – Transition from Junior Advance to Semi-senior Level

This evaluation system is based on a points model:
- **Basic:** 1 point  
- **Intermediate:** 3 points  
- **Advanced:** 5 points  
- **Expert:** 7 points (applicable at the Senior level)

To advance from **Junior Advance** to **Semi-senior**, candidates must:
1. Achieve at least the minimum required level in each **Core** skill.
2. Reach a total minimum score across all evaluated skills.

### Total Minimum Points Calculation

- **Core Skills Total:**  
  SQL (3) + OOP & Programming (3) + Java (3) + REST Services (3) + Persistence Frameworks (3) + Spring (3) + Transactions (3) + CI/CD (3) + Design Patterns (3) + Git (3) + Test (3) = **33 points**

- **Secondary Skills Total:**  
  Soft Skills (3) + Workstation (1) + Web (1) + Scrum (1) + Logging (1) + Building/Packaging (1) + Documentation (1) + Spring Ecosystem (3) = **12 points**

- **Overall Total Minimum Required:** 33 + 12 = **45 points**

## Validation Process for Advancement

To be eligible for advancement from **Junior Advance** to **Semi-senior**, a candidate must satisfy both conditions:

1. **Core Skills Requirement:**  
   The candidate must demonstrate at least the minimum required proficiency for each Core skill:
   - **SQL:** At least Intermediate (3 points)
   - **OOP & Programming:** At least Intermediate (3 points)
   - **Java:** At least Intermediate (3 points)
   - **REST Services:** At least Intermediate (3 points)
   - **Persistence Frameworks (JPA):** At least Intermediate (3 points)
   - **Spring:** At least Intermediate (3 points)
   - **Transactions:** At least Intermediate (3 points)
   - **CI/CD:** At least Intermediate (3 points)
   - **Design Patterns:** At least Intermediate (3 points)
   - **Git:** At least Intermediate (3 points)
   - **Test:** At least Intermediate (3 points)

   *If any one of these Core skills is below the required minimum, the candidate cannot advance—even if the overall score meets the threshold.*

2. **Total Points Requirement:**  
   The candidate’s overall score—calculated by summing the points from all evaluated skills—must be **at least 45 points**.
   - *For example, if a candidate’s total score is 44 points, they do not meet the threshold to advance.*

A candidate can only advance from Junior Advance to Semi-senior if both conditions are met.
