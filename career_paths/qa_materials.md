| Dive deep into Test Driven Development            | Mastering TDD is crucial to being an effective software developer. As a Sr Test Automation Engineer, you will be often challenged by bugs produced as a consequence of low-quality code. TDD gives you the mindset on how to structure applications from a testing perspective, helping you to: Implement your classes and methods based on requirements, improve debugging by having smaller pieces of code, better understand development challenges and adapt your test automation strategy to help mitigate them, among others. | [Learn TDD in 24hs (Udemy)](https://globant.udemy.com/course/test-driven-development-for-professionals/)                                              | Level 4 | Sr Lvl 1 | Test Design and Execution  | Test/Script Design                 | Test Driven Development, Test Case Design, Automation good practices, UI Automated Testing Design                                                                                                             |
